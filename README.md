# End-to-End Pyspark Databricks Project


## Project Overview
This project focuses on building multiple data pipelines in Databricks, designed to handle various data formats such as CSV, Delta, and Parquet. The pipelines perform data extraction, transformation using PySpark, and loading the processed data into data lakes and Delta lakes. The project was guided by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlWS4foN9cY), providing a hands-on approach to designing scalable and maintainable data pipelines.

### Key Learnings and Features:
- Pipeline Design: Gained insights into designing extensible data pipelines to simplify the integration of new workflows.
- Factory Design Pattern: Utilized for efficient and reusable data transformation and data loading processes.
- Delta Lake Concepts: Explored features like Delta tables, DBFS, and the benefits of the Parquet format for big data management.
- Performance Optimization: Learned techniques like repartitioning, bucketing, and broadcasting to enhance data workflow performance.
